A breast cancer prediction project is a machine learning model that is trained to predict the likelihood that a person will develop breast cancer based on certain characteristics or risk factors. These characteristics could include things like age, family history, reproductive history, and hormone use, as well as genetic mutations that have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
